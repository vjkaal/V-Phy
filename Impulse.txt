Impulse (J or Imp) is the integral of a force, F, over time interval, t, for which it acts.
Vector quantity.
SI unit: N s.
other systems: kg m/s, lbf s, slug ft/s.
briefly.
J = F[avg](t2 − t1)
also,J = ∫ F dt
Impulse J produced from time t1 to t2 is defined to be[2]

J = [t1]∫[t2]  F dt
F=dp/dt
J=p2-p1=mv2-mv1
