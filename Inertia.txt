Inertia : the resistance of any physical object to any change in it's velocity.
It is the tendency of an object to keep moving in a straight line when no force acts upon it.
Acc. to Newton, an object will stay at rest or in motion, unless acted upon by a net external force, whether be gravity, friction, contact, or some other force.
