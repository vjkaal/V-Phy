        <dfn>Statistical Physics</dfn>: It is the branch of physics, which uses probability and statitics, and particularly mathematical tools to deal with large values and approximations, in solving physical problems.<br>
        <dfn>Statistical Probability</dfn>: It is defined as th ratio of no of cases in which the event occurs to the total no of trials carried out.
